"""Paths for bundled resources.

`Path(__file__).parents[N]` math is brittle when the same chain is repeated
in multiple modules — they drift apart silently when files move. Every
bundled-resource location lives here.

Two layouts are supported:

* **Wheel install** (`pip install patchdiff-ai` / `pip install git+...`):
  hatchling's `force-include` projects `resources/bindiff_ida_9.3/` into
  `<package>/_resources/bindiff_ida_9.3/` so the DLLs travel with the
  wheel.
* **Editable install** (`pip install -e .`) and direct source-tree runs:
  no projection happens; the package points back at the original
  `<repo>/resources/bindiff_ida_9.3/`.

`_resolve_bundled_bindiff_dir()` checks both at import time. The
`PROJECT_ROOT` constant only makes sense in the source-tree layout and is
kept for that case; callers should treat it as "may not exist" under
wheel installs.
